# Session N — Short Title
> One-sentence purpose of the session.
>
> **Use when:** Every entry; this is the canonical title and brief purpose.  
> **Skip when:** Never.

---

## 1) Activity Goals
- [x] Implement ______ (e.g., ROS2 node publishing joint states)
- [x] Validate ______ (e.g., Ackermann kinematics constraint)
- [x] Document ______ (e.g., BOM with costs, wiring diagram)
>
> **Use when:** Always, to define the goals of the activity; mark as checkboxes and evaluate at the end.  
> **Skip when:** Never

---

## 2) Materials & Setup
**BOM (bill of materials)**

| # | Item | Qty | Link/Source | Cost (MXN) | Notes |
|---|------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | ______ | __ | ______ | __ | ______ |

**Tools/Software**
- OS/Env: Ubuntu 24.04 + ROS 2 Jazzy (WSL2 ok)
- Editors: VS Code, Python 3.12, Arduino IDE, RoboDK (if used)
- Slicers/ECAD: PrusaSlicer, Altium, Multisim

**Wiring / Safety**
- Motor driver current limit: __ A (≤ spec)  
- Battery: LiPo __S, follow charging protocol  
- PPE / Risk notes: ______
>
> **Use when:** Hardware or software setup affects reproducibility or safety; include current limits and battery notes.  
> **Skip when:** Pure software simulation with no hardware or safety changes; still list software versions briefly.

---

## 3) Procedure (what you did)
1. Step 1: Concise action with command(s)
   ```bash
   # Example: build ROS workspace
   colcon build --symlink-install
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
2. Step 2: Screenshots/console logs as needed
3. Step 3: Verification checkpoint ✅
>
> **Use when:** Documenting steps so another student can reproduce results from a clean state.  
> **Skip when:** Only design discussion or planning occurred; move notes to Reflection and Analysis.


---

## 4) Data, Tests & Evidence
**Test plan**
- Inputs: ______
- Expected: ______
- Metrics: RMSE, latency, current draw, etc.

**Results**
```text
# Paste concise logs or metrics
mean_error = 2.3 deg
latency_ms = 14.8
```

**Tables/plots**
| Case | Input | Output | Error | Pass? |
|------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| A | … | … | … | ✅/❌ |
>
> **Use when:** You measured, tested, or compared against expected behavior; include raw evidence and brief summaries.  
> **Skip when:** Nothing was executed; defer to Procedure or Reflection.

---

## 5) Analysis 
- Compare expected vs observed.  
- Explain anomalies (friction, backlash, sampling, clipping).  
- Link to equations/constraints (e.g., Pfaffian for nonholonomic: A(q)·q_dot = 0).  Equations should be in a readable format (LaTeX or code). For example:  
  $$
  A(q) \cdot \dot{q} = 0
  $$

- Propose fixes (calibration, PID gains, step timing).
>
> **Use when:** Data exists or you made claims that require justification; tie to theory.  
> **Skip when:** Session only set up infrastructure with no results; provide a short note and defer deeper analysis to a later entry.

---

## 6) Code
Short, runnable snippets only. Link big files to repo.

```python
# Example: publish joint states
# SAFETY: respect joint limits before publishing
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import JointState
```
```cpp
// Example: Arduino motor test (watch current & temperature)
```
>
> **Use when:** A snippet clarifies the approach, parameters, or API usage; keep it executable and minimal.  
> **Skip when:** Code is long; link to repository paths and commits instead.

---

## 7) Files & Media
- CAD/URDF: /urdf/arm_3dof.urdf.xacro
- Launch: /launch/sim.launch.py
- Firmware: /firmware/drive_test/
- Video demo (≤60 s): https://…  
- Photos: img/sessionN_*
>
> **Use when:** Artifacts help a reviewer verify function or build the same setup.  
> **Skip when:** No media or files were changed; omit to keep the entry concise.

<!--
Guidance for students:
- Duplicate per session: YYYY-MM-DD-session-N.md
- Keep headings; delete unused sections entirely rather than leaving them blank.
- Place safety notes near motor/battery actions.
- Link long code to repo; pin versions for reproducibility.
- Add at least one reflection item per entry.
-->
