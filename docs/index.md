# **Embedded Systems II (13409)** 


## **Course Description**

This course develops practical competencies in advanced embedded communication and industrial connectivity using the ESP32-C6 and ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS. Students move from superloop firmware to RTOS-based, thread-safe architectures, emphasizing event-driven design, task scheduling, and safe peripheral access in concurrent systems. The course then focuses on modern IoT communication stacks: Wi-Fi (TCP/IP, HTTPS/REST, MQTT, WebSockets), Bluetooth Low Energy (GAP/GATT), and 802.15.4 mesh networking (Zigbee and Thread with Matter concepts), complemented by industrial protocols including TWAI (CAN) and Modbus TCP.
